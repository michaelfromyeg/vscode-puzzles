<p>
A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \times n$  
board in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.

</p>
<p>
We call such a position an <dfn>open</dfn> position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. 
</p>
<p>Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \times n$ chessboard.<br>
For example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3 \times 3$ chessboard below.

<p>
You are also given $f(5)=70$.</p>
<p>Find $f(10^8)$ modulo $1\,008\,691\,207$.</p>
