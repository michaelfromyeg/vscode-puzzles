The following diagram shows a billiard table of a special quadrilateral shape.
The four angles $A, B, C, D$ are $120^\circ, 90^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ$ respectively, and the lengths $AB$ and $AD$ are equal.

<p>
The diagram on the left shows the trace of an infinitesimally small billiard ball, departing from point $A$, bouncing twice on the edges of the table, and finally returning back to point $A$. The diagram on the right shows another such trace, but this time bouncing eight times:

<p>
The table has no friction and all bounces are perfect elastic collisions.<br />
Note that no bounce should happen on any of the corners, as the behaviour would be unpredictable.
</p>

<p>
Let $B(N)$ be the number of possible traces of the ball, departing from point $A$, bouncing at most $N$ times on the edges and returning back to point $A$.
</p>

<p>
For example, $B(10) = 6$, $B(100) = 478$, $B(1000) = 45790$.
</p>

<p>
Find $B(10^9)$.
