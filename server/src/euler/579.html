<p>A <strong>lattice cube</strong> is a cube in which all vertices have integer coordinates. Let $C(n)$ be the number of different lattice cubes in which the coordinates of all vertices range between (and including) $0$ and $n$. Two cubes are hereby considered different if any of their vertices have different coordinates.<br>
For example, $C(1)=1$, $C(2)=9$, $C(4)=100$, $C(5)=229$, $C(10)=4469$ and $C(50)=8154671$.
</p>
<p>Different cubes may contain different numbers of lattice points.</p>
<p>
For example, the cube with the vertices<br>
$(0, 0, 0)$, $(3, 0, 0)$, $(0, 3, 0)$, $(0, 0, 3)$, $(0, 3, 3)$, $(3, 0, 3)$, $(3, 3, 0)$, $(3, 3, 3)$ contains $64$ lattice points ($56$ lattice points on the surface including the $8$ vertices and $8$ points within the cube). </p>
<p>In contrast, the cube with the vertices<br>
$(0, 2, 2)$, $(1, 4, 4)$, $(2, 0, 3)$, $(2, 3, 0)$, $(3, 2, 5)$, $(3, 5, 2)$, $(4, 1, 1)$, $(5, 3, 3)$ contains only $40$ lattice points ($20$ points on the surface and $20$ points within the cube), although both cubes have the same side length $3$.
</p>
<p>
Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the lattice points contained in the different lattice cubes in which the coordinates of all vertices range between (and including) $0$ and $n$.</p>

<p>For example, $S(1)=8$, $S(2)=91$, $S(4)=1878$, $S(5)=5832$, $S(10)=387003$ and $S(50)=29948928129$.</p>

<p>Find $S(5000) \bmod 10^9$.</p>
