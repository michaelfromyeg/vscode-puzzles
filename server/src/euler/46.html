<p>It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.</p>
\begin{align}
9 = 7 + 2 \times 1^2\\
15 = 7 + 2 \times 2^2\\
21 = 3 + 2 \times 3^2\\
25 = 7 + 2 \times 3^2\\
27 = 19 + 2 \times 2^2\\
33 = 31 + 2 \times 1^2
\end{align}
<p>It turns out that the conjecture was false.</p>
<p>What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?</p>
