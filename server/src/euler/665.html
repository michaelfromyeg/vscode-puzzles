<p>Two players play a game with two piles of stones, alternating turns.</p>
<p>On each turn, the corresponding player chooses a positive integer $n$ and does one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>removes $n$ stones from one pile;</li>
<li>removes $n$ stones from both piles; or</li>
<li>removes $n$ stones from one pile and $2n$ stones from the other pile.</li>
</ul><p>The player who removes the last stone wins.</p>

<p>We denote by $(n,m)$ the position in which the piles have $n$ and $m$ stones remaining. Note that $(n,m)$ is considered to be the same position as $(m,n)$.</p>

<p>Then, for example, if the position is $(2,6)$, the next player may reach the following positions:<br />
$(0,2)$, $(0,4)$, $(0,5)$, $(0,6)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,4)$, $(1,5)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(2,5)$</p>

<p>A position is a losing position if the player to move next cannot force a win. For example, $(1,3)$, $(2,6)$, $(4,5)$ are the first few losing positions.</p>

<p>Let $f(M)$ be the sum of $n+m$ for all losing positions $(n,m)$ with $n\le m$ and $n+m \le M$. For example, $f(10) = 21$, by considering the losing positions $(1,3)$, $(2,6)$, $(4,5)$.</p>
<p>You are given that $f(100) = 1164$ and $f(1000) = 117002$.</p>

<p>Find $f(10^7)$.</p>
