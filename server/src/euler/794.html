<p>This problem uses half open interval notation where $[a,b)$ represents $a \le x &lt; b$.</p>

<p>A real number, $x_1$, is chosen in the interval $[0,1)$.<br />
A second real number, $x_2$, is chosen such that each of $[0,\frac{1}{2})$ and $[\frac{1}{2},1)$ contains exactly one of $(x_1, x_2)$.<br />
Continue such that on the $n$-th step a real number, $x_n$, is chosen so that each of the intervals $[\frac{k-1}{n}, \frac{k}{n})$ for $k \in \{1, ..., n\}$ contains exactly one of $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$.</p>

<p>Define $F(n)$ to be the minimal value of the sum $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$ of a tuple $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ chosen by such a procedure. For example, $F(4) = 1.5$ obtained with $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25)$.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, no more than $17$ points can be chosen by this procedure. </p>

<p>Find $F(17)$ and give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places.</p>
