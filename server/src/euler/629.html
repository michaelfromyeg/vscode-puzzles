<p>Alice and Bob are playing a modified game of Nim called Scatterstone Nim, with Alice going first, alternating turns with Bob. The game begins with an arbitrary set of stone piles with a total number of stones equal to $n$.</p>

<p>During a player's turn, he/she must pick a pile having at least $2$ stones and perform a split operation, dividing the pile into an arbitrary set of $p$ non-empty, arbitrarily-sized piles where $2 \leq p \leq k$ for some fixed constant $k$. For example, a pile of size $4$ can be split into $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 2\}$, or $\{1, 1, 2\}$ if $k = 3$ and in addition $\{1, 1, 1, 1\}$ if $k = 4$.</p>

<p>If no valid move is possible on a given turn, then the other player wins the game.</p>

<p>A winning position is defined as a set of stone piles where a player can ultimately ensure victory no matter what the other player does.</p>

<p>Let $f(n,k)$ be the number of winning positions for Alice on her first turn, given parameters $n$ and $k$. For example, $f(5, 2) = 3$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}$. In contrast, $f(5, 3) = 5$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{5\}$.</p>

<p>Let $g(n)$ be the sum of $f(n,k)$ over all $2 \leq k \leq n$. For example, $g(7)=66$ and $g(10)=291$.</p>

<p>Find $g(200) \bmod (10^9 + 7)$.</p>
