<p>An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
$$0.12345678910{\color{red}\mathbf 1}112131415161718192021\cdots$$</p>
<p>It can be seen that the $12$<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part is $1$.</p>
<p>If $d_n$ represents the $n$<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
$$d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}$$</p>
