Jack has three plates in front of him. The giant has $N$ beans that he distributes to the three plates. All the beans look the same, but one of them is a magic bean. Jack doesn't know which one it is, but the giant knows.</p>

<p>
Jack can ask the giant questions of the form: "Does this subset of the beans contain the magic bean?" In each question Jack may choose any subset of beans from a single plate, and the giant will respond truthfully.</p>

<p>
If the three plates contain $a$, $b$ and $c$ beans respectively, we let $h(a, b, c)$ be the minimal number of questions Jack needs to ask in order to guarantee he locates the magic bean. For example, $h(1, 2, 3) = 3$ and $h(2, 3, 3) = 4$.</p>

<p>
Let $H(N)$ be the sum of $h(a, b, c)$ over all triples of non-negative integers $a$, $b$, $c$ with $1 \leq a + b + c \leq N$.<br>
You are given: $H(6) = 203$ and $H(20) = 7718$.</p>

<p>
A <strong>repunit</strong>, $R_n$, is a number made up with $n$ digits all '1'. For example, $R_3 = 111$ and $H(R_3) = 1634144$.</p>

<p>
Find $H(R_{19})$. Give your answer modulo  $1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>
