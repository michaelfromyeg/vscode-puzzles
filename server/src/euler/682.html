<p>$5$-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed $5$.<br>
$5$-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.</p>

<p>Let $\Omega(a)$ be the count of prime factors of $a$ (counted with multiplicity).<br>
Let $s(a)$ be the sum of the prime factors of $a$ (with multiplicity).<br>
For example, $\Omega(300) = 5$ and $s(300) = 2+2+3+5+5 = 17$.</p>

<p>Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs, $(p,q)$, of Hamming numbers such that $\Omega(p)=\Omega(q)$ and $s(p)+s(q)=n$.<br>
You are given $f(10)=4$ (the pairs are $(4,9),(5,5),(6,6),(9,4)$) and $f(10^2)=3629$.</p>

<p>Find $f(10^7) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>
